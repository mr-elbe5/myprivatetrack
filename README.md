# myprivatetrack
IOS app for your private track - private diary using text, camera, audio, video and map

This app is designed for private data. None of your entered data leaves your iPhone or iPad, if you do not explicitly export it. 
There are no ads. 
The only use of the network is for getting map tiles and the location service for showing the location of your entries on the map.
Mostly Apple APIs and services are used, only one third party software is used for zipping and unzipping files (open source as well).
All code is published on GitHub under https://github.com/mr-elbe5/myprivatetrack.git for your survey if you like.
